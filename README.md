  `swiff.log` includes max size settings to manage log file size:
  ```js
  logging: {
    enabled: true,
    dir: '', // Default root: "./storage/logs/"
    maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // Recommended 10MB max log file size
  },
  ```

- **Multi-Environment Support:**
  ```js
  defaultEnvironment: "staging",
  environments: {
    staging: {
      user: "",   
      host: "",  
      appPath: "",
      port: 22,
    },
    production: {
      user: "",   
      host: "",  
      appPath: "",    
      port: 22,
    },
  },
  ```

## Requirements
Swiff requires Node.js LTS version (16.0.0+).

Place the following in `swiff.config.js` at the root of your application:

```js
export default {
  defaultEnvironment: "staging",
  logging: {
    enabled: true,
    // dir: '', // Default root: "./storage/logs/"
    maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // Recommended 10MB max log file size
  },
  environments: {
    staging: {
      user: "",   
      host: "",  
      appPath: "",
      port: 22,
    },
    production: {
      user: "",   
      host: "",  
      appPath: "",    
      port: 22,
    },
  },
  local: {
    ddev: true,
  },
  env: {
    prefix: null, // Example: "CRAFT_" for projects above version 4
  },
  pushFolders: [
    // { path: "config", exclude: "/project/*" },
    // 'templates',
    // 'public/dist'
  ],
  pullFolders: [
    // 'public/assets/volumes'
  ],
  disabled: ["databasePush"],
};
```
Swiff works with MySQL databases and supports `ddev` (requires `local.ddev = true`).
